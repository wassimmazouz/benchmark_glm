def run_one_resolution(objective, solver, meta, stop_val):
    """Run one resolution of the solver.

    Parameters
    ----------
    objective : instance of BaseObjective
        The objective to minimize.
    solver : instance of BaseSolver
        The solver to use.
    meta : dict
        Metadata passed to store in Cost results.
        Contains objective, data, dimension, id_rep.
    stop_val : int | float
        Corresponds to stopping criterion, such as
        tol or max_iter for the solver. It depends
        on the sampling_strategy for the solver.

    Returns
    -------
    cost : dict
        Details on the run and the objective value obtained.
